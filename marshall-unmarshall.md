# Marshall-Unmarshall




Unmarshal or decode?
Unmarshal is the function used for decoding. There is also a method called Decode in the json package, where its name is self explanatory of what it does. There is often a misconception between these two.

Which one should you use? As to every good question, the answer is, it depends. If you are reading values from an input stream, decode will be the right option for you.

We will be using the unmarshal function in this post. So letâ€™s decode some JSON in Go!
